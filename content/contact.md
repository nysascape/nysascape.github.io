If you ever need to contact me, well:
I'm pretty much always on [Telegram](https://t.me/nysascape), sometimes I'm busy and may not get around to your message. I sleep mostly from 12/1am - 7/10pm GMT, so I might be asleep.

If you don't have Telegram, no problem. You can always catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nysascape), or E-Mail (for formal matters) [jago@nysascape.tech](mailto: jago@nysascape.tech)

Any other socials you might find my handle under are not always reliable, and I might not be there to instantly respond.
