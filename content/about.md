Hi! Welcome to my about page.

I'm Jago Gardiner, mostly known on the internet as nysa[scape, dev], a 16 year
old from the UK. I study Computer Science, Photography and Maths at A-Level,
and I'm currently in my first year of study.

I mostly work in ROM development and kernel development, which is what I'm
mostly known for. I'm a beginner security researcher also, and I'm dabbling
in some AI development due to my Computer Science class exploring it.

I currently run Windows 10 Pro on my machine alongside Ubuntu 18/19.xx. For
programming, my main language is C# - but I know C, Java and some HTML. I use
bash scripting for literally everything - CI for the win, am I right?

Termius is my #1 tool of choice. It's an amazing SSH client and allows me to
be always connected to my VPS - for which I use Google Cloud and Microsoft
Azure. I'm looking to get a dedicated 24h VPS soon, such as Vultr. For my
IDE, I have a subscription to the JetBrains suite for Linux, and I, of
course, use Microsoft VS 2019 for Windows. VS Code is my portable editor of
choice and I could not exist without the Office 365 suite.

In my personal life, I like to skate, surf, take photos, and love music.
I spend a lot of time with my amazing girlfriend and try to balance my time
between programming, studies and life - it's really important to not burn
yourself out.

If you see anyone with the username nysadev, or nysascape, you can be mostly
sure it's me.
