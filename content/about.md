Hi! Welcome to my about page.

I'm Jago Gardiner, mostly known on the internet as nysa[scape, dev], a 16 year
old from the UK. I study Computer Science, Photography and Maths at A-Level,
and I'm currently in my first year of study.

I mostly work in ROM development and kernel development, which is what I'm
mostly known for. I'm a beginner security researcher also, and I'm dabbling
in some AI development due to my Computer Science class exploring it.

In places that aren't computer related, I skate and surf mainly due to my
background and the culture of where I live - I also do boxing and fitness
to balance my desk life out. I play guitar to name another hobby but I'm not
the best at it.
