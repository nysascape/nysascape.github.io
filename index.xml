      <description>Hi! Welcome to my about page.
In short, I&amp;rsquo;m a 17 year old security researcher/computer science student from the UK, interested in Android development, cyber security, Photography and Maths. Aside from the technical stuff, I enjoy skating, surfing, and Italian food.
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m in Year 12, studying Maths, Photography and Computer Science at A-Level. Plans for the future are to continue my CS studies at University but who knows what can happen.</description>

      <description>If you ever need to contact me, well: I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much always on Telegram, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m busy and may not get around to your message. I sleep mostly from 12/1am - 7/10pm GMT, so I might be asleep.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Telegram, no problem. You can always catch me on Instagram, or E-Mail (for formal matters) jago@nysascape.tech
Any other socials you might find my handle under are not always reliable, and I might not be there to instantly respond.</description>
