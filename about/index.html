                <p>Hi! Welcome to my about page.</p>

<p>In short, I&rsquo;m a 17 year old security researcher/computer science student from the UK,
interested in Android development, cyber security, Photography and Maths. Aside from
the technical stuff, I enjoy skating, surfing, photography and travelling.</p>

<p>Currently I&rsquo;m in Year 13, studying Maths, Photography and Computer Science at A-Level.
Plans for the future are to continue my CS studies at University but who knows what can
happen. My future career would hopefully be somewhere in the cyber security realm, which
I&rsquo;m also looking for work experience for at the moment, to get experience in the field.</p>

<p>Why nysascape? I love the night sky, and while I know nothing about Astronomy, I do
like the names we give our stars. Nysa, the first part, was something that really stuck
out to me while I was looking at star names. It&rsquo;s why a lot of my works, such as my
kernels for the 8 Lite, are named after stars. Originally, my name ended with -dev, as
I decided this would be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; as a 13 year old aspiring developer, who knew nothing,
but as time grew and I joined the devscapes team, I eventually migrated to -scape. Why,
I&rsquo;m not sure, but it has grown on me since. I use @nysa where I can, but this is rare -
if you find me on anything named @nysascape, you can usually be sure it is me.</p>

<p>Phones I&rsquo;ve owned over the years: Pixel 3XL, Pixel 3a, MI 8 Lite, Moto E3 and G4 Play,
iPhone 5s, 6s, 7, Xperia L2 and E3, and a few others I probably can&rsquo;t name.</p>
